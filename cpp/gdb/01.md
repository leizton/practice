# commands
- step `s`
    run until a different source line, then stop running
    abbreviated `s`
- next `n`
    similar to step
    but function calls are executed without stopping
- until `u`
    avoid single stepping through a loop more than once.
    快速跳过循环体
- continue `c`
    恢复执行

# example
```sh
$ g++ -g main.cc
$ gdb a.out
(gdb) break main
(gdb) run
(gdb) n
(gdb) run  # 回到开始重跑
(gdb) c
(gdb) quit
```
